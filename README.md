# E-commerce Back End

## Description

For this project I was tasked with backend data manipulation. I was given seed data to populate a database, and then tasked with creating code that would correspond with CRUD commands for updating the data within the database. This project helped me with the following concepts:

-Creating and manipulating databases with MySQL<br>
-Using the dotenv package to conceal my MySQL login info<br>
-Creating database models<br>
-Creating API routes that led to CRUD operations<br>
-Familiarizing myself with the Insomnia application, which helped me see my backend updates occur.

## Installation

Open the integrated terminal and login to MySQL. Create the database, seed the data, and run the server to begin.
